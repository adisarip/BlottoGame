# Blotto Game

A Blotto Game or Colonel Blotto is a type of two-person Zero-Sum game where players simultaneously distribute limited resources over several fronts (or battlefields). In the classic version of the game, the player devoting the most resources to a battlefield wins that battlefield, and the gain (or payoff) is then equal to the total number of battlefields won.
